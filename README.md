Instance Manager for ColdFusion

![alt tag](./assets/mainview.png)

Go to releases to download the newest version.

This only works with ColdFusion11 and Apache.

Backup your httpd-vhosts or your mod_jk before doing any changes on the app.

**Note: In order for CFInstancemanager to correctly read your old instances your .properties name must be the same as your instance.

Example:

Instance ID: cftest

Properties Filename must be: cftest.properties
